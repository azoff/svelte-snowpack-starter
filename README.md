# Svelte App Boilerplate

Package includes:

- [svelte]: Instead of React. I like writing less code.
- [snowpack]: Webpack is dog slow. ES Modules are already here.
- [flexboxgrid]: Tried and true grid system based off of flexbox.
- [normalize]: I prefer my diversity in the workplace, not my browswer.
- [prettier]: Less time spent formatting, more time spent coding.
- [eslint]: Admittedly not as potent with typescript, but good practice.
- [svelte-media]: For programatically creating responsive UI.
